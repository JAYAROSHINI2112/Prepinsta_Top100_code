Removing spaces from a string.
In this article we will how to code
a C program to remove spaces from a string. 
In order to do so we will use a while loop that
will iterate each character of the string. Then if 
the character iterated by the while loop is not 
a blank space then we will store this character in 
a new string . And as the while loop ends our objective is achieved. 



#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int n,i,j;
    char str[20];
    scanf("%[^\n]s",&str);
    
    for(i = 0; str[i]!= '\0'; i++)
    {
        while(str[i] == ' ')
        {
            for(j = i; str[j] != '\0'; j++)
             str[j] = str[j+1];
             
           // str[j] = '\0'; 
        }
    }
    printf("%s",str);
}

Output:
Enter the string
PREP INSTA 
The string after removing all the spaces is:     
PREPINSTA
