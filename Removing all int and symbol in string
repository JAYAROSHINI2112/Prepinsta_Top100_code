In this article we will learn how to code a C program to remove all
characters from string except alphabets. In the process to do this all the
special characters (!,@,#,etc.) and numeric characters (1,2,3,etc.) need to 
removed from the string. To remove the characters we will check each characters 
of the string , if the character checked found to be a non alphabetical character
then we will remove the character and store the 
remaining string as it is. We will iterate this step through a for loop until every
non alphabet character is removed.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int n,i,j;
    char str[20];
    scanf("%s",&str);
    
    for(i = 0; str[i]!= '\0'; i++)
    {
        while(!((str[i] >= 'A' && str[i] <= 'Z') || (str[i] >= 'a' && str[i] <= 'z') || str[i] == '\0'))
        {
            for(j = i; str[j] != '\0'; j++)
             str[j] = str[j+1];
             
           // str[j] = '\0'; 
        }
    }
    printf("%s",str);
}
Output:
Enter a string : *1prep_insta*
After removing non alphabetical characters the string is :prepinsta
