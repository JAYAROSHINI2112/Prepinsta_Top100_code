Calculating frequency of characters in a string.
In this article we will learn how to code a C program 
to calculate frequency of characters in the string. Calculating
frequency means to calculate how many times each character is present 
in a string. To calculate this we will use a for loop that will iterate each
character of the string and then store
the count of each of the characters in an array. Then we will use another 
for loop to print the frequency of each character that we have stored in an array.


#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    //Initializing variables.
    char str[100];
    int i;
    int freq[256] = {0};
    
    //Accepting inputs.
    printf("Enter the string: ");
    gets(str);
    
    //Calculating frequency of each character.
    for(i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; i++)
    {
        freq[str[i]]++;
    }
    
    //Printing frequency of each character.
    for(i = 0; i < 256; i++)
    {
        if(freq[i] != 0)
        {
            printf("The frequency of %c is %d\n", i, freq[i]);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
