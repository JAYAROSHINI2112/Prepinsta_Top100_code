Counting the sum of numbers in a string.
In this article we will learn how to code 
a C program to count the sum of numbers in a 
string. To do this we will be using a for loop 
that will iterate each character of the string and 
check if the character iterated is a numeric value or not.
And if it is found to be a numeric value then we will add that 
value into the variable that we have assigned to store the sum of the numbers.


#include <stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
    int n,i,j,sum=0,val;
    char str[20],l;
    scanf("%s",&str);
    
    for(i = 0; str[i]!= '\0'; i++)
    {
       if(str[i] >= '0' && str[i] <= '9')
        {
           sum += str[i] - '0';
        }
    }
    printf("%d",sum);
}

Output:
Enter the string:
4PREP2INSTA6  
Sum of all digits:
12
