Finding non repeating characters in a string.
In this article we will learn how to code a 
C program to find non repeating characters in a string.
Non repeating characters are those that are present in the 
string only once. To find non repeating characters in a string we will
use one for loop to calculate the frequency of each character and print those
characters that have frequency count one using another for loop.



#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    //Initializing variables.
    char str[100];
    int i;
    int freq[256] = {0};
    
    //Accepting inputs.
    printf("Enter the string: ");
    gets(str);
    
    //Calculating frequency of each character.
    for(i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; i++)
    {
        freq[str[i]]++;
    }
    
    //Printing frequency of each character.
    for(i = 0; i < 256; i++)
    {
        if(freq[i] != 0 && freq[i] == 1)
        {
            printf("%c \n", i);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}


Output:
Enter the string: prepinsta
The non repeating characters are:  a  e  i  n  r  s  t
