Program to determine the occurence of elements in an given array.
In this program we will find the occurence of the unique element present in the given input array.

Let we have an array a[ ] = {1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1}.

So the frequency of the distinct elements will be:

  1 occurs 2 times
  2 occurs 3 times
  3 occurs 1 times.
  
  
  #include<stdio.h>

int main ()
{

  int n;			// variable to store the size of an array.

  printf ("Enter the size of the array : ");
  scanf ("%d", &n);		// takes the size of the array from the user

  int arr[n];			// Declare the array arr of size n that contains the elements of the array.
  int visited[n];		// Declare the array named visited of n size to mark 1 for the visted elements.

  // Takes the elements of the array from the user
  printf ("\nEnter the elemnts o the array: ");

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    scanf ("%d", &arr[i]);

  // Traversing the array and find print the frequency of the elements

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
      // check if that element is visited or not
      if (visited[i] == 1)
	  continue;

      int count = 1;		// variable that count the frequency of the arr[i] element.

      for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++)
	  {
	    if (arr[i] == arr[j])
	      {
	        count++;
	        visited[j] = 1;
	      }
	  }

      printf ("\n %d occurs %d times", arr[i], count);
    }

  return 0;
}
